        <h1>The Best Moives by Pranav</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 moives of all time </h2>
<hr />
<h3>URI:THE SURGICAL STRIKE</h3>
<p>This moive is all about the planning and execution of the retaliation and revenge India gave back to 
    Pakistan by destroying almost 5-7 of their terrorist camps by sending in 4 teams of Para special 
    forces for the task.</p>

    <h3>THE LONE SURVIVOR</h3>
    <p>This moive is about how 4 US navy seals were sent on an operation but due to some unavoidable circumstances
        the terroists get to know about them and 3 of them eventually die fighting back but 1 seal survives in the
        hard terrain for 10 days after which he is evacuated by the US army by launching a full operation. </p>

<h3>YEH JAWANI HE DIWANI</h3>
    <p>This moive is about 4 friends who go on a trek to Manali where they have the best time of their lives but due
       to carrer choices they have to part ways at the end of the trip leading to arguments and misunderstandings. But 
        they eventually meet and reunite after many years for their best friend's wedding.
